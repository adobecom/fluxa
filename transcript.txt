1. Prepare Your Layers

Open your Background Image in Photoshop.

Place your Subject Image on top (File > Place Embedded).

Remove the Background of your subject if it isn't already transparent (Select the layer > Click "Remove Background" in the Contextual Task Bar or Properties panel).

2. Rasterize the Subject Layer

Crucial Step: The "Match Color" option might be grayed out if your subject is a Smart Object.

Right-click on the text part of your Subject layer in the Layers panel.

Select Rasterize Layer. (Alternatively, you can select the layer and go to Layer > Rasterize > Smart Object).

3. Apply Match Color

With the Subject layer selected, go to the top menu: Image > Adjustments > Match Color...

A dialog box will appear. Ignore the top "Image Options" for a moment and look at the Image Statistics section at the bottom:

Source: Click the dropdown and select the current file name you are working on.

Layer: Click the dropdown and select your Background layer (the one you want to match the colors from).

4. Adjust the Blending

Now, go back up to the Image Options section to fine-tune the look:

Luminance: Adjusts the brightness. Usually, you need to lower this if your subject is too bright for the scene.

Color Intensity: Controls how saturated the colors are. Adjust this until the subject's color saturation matches the background.

Fade: Controls the strength of the effect. If the color change is too drastic, increase the "Fade" slightly to bring back some of the original colors.

Click OK.
