1. Prepare the Image

Open your image in Photoshop.

Duplicate the Background Layer: Press Ctrl + J (Windows) or Cmd + J (Mac). You now have "Layer 1".

2. Convert to Black & White

With "Layer 1" selected, remove the color by desaturating it.

Shortcut: Press Ctrl + Shift + U (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + U (Mac).

Alternative: Go to Image > Adjustments > Desaturate.

3. Create the "Negative" Layer

Duplicate the Desaturated Layer: Press Ctrl + J / Cmd + J again. You now have "Layer 1 copy".

Invert the Colors: Press Ctrl + I / Cmd + I. The image will look like a film negative (dark areas become light, light areas become dark).

4. The "Disappearing" Trick (Color Dodge)

Change the Blending Mode of this top layer ("Layer 1 copy") from Normal to Color Dodge.

Result: The image will likely turn almost completely white. This is normal! The sketch effect relies on the difference between this layer and the one below it.

5. Reveal the Sketch (Gaussian Blur)

Go to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur.

A dialog box will appear. Adjust the Radius slider.

What to look for: As you increase the radius, the pencil lines will start to appear.

Low Radius: Thin, faint lines.

High Radius: Thicker, darker lines with more shading.

Recommended: Try a value between 10 and 50 pixels depending on your image resolution. Click OK.

6. Darken the Lines (Levels)

The sketch might look a bit faint or low contrast. To fix this, add a Levels adjustment layer.

Click the Create new fill or adjustment layer icon (half-filled circle) at the bottom of the Layers panel and choose Levels.

In the Properties panel, drag the Shadows slider (the black triangle on the left) slightly to the right to darken the blacks.

Drag the Midtones slider (the gray triangle in the middle) to the right to clean up the grey noise and make the white paper background brighter.
